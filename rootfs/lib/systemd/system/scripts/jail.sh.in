# nuke the jails on boot, in case we ota to a new kernel with

# so there shouldn't be any.

# only wipe the jails if the webos_release or webos_build_id has changed
# (e.g. after system update)
# Because to build an image on developer's local machine with a new kernel
# doesn't affect the webos_release or webos_build_id value,
# developers who want to test a new kernel with different device node numbers
# should wipe the jails. (rm -rf @WEBOS_INSTALL_WEBOS_LOCALSTATEDIR@/jail/*)
